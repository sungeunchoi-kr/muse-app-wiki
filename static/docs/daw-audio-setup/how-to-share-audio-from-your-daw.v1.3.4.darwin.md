If your DAW isn't compatible with the Muse Plugin, you can use Muse Audio Share to share audio from your DAW. Using Muse Audio Share requires less setup, but you might hear a slight playback delay. To share audio without a delay, use a [Multi-Output device](museapp://tutorials/daw-audio-setup/how-to-share-audio-from-your-daw-with-muse-multi-output).

### 1. Select Muse Audio Share (System Audio) below or from Museâ€™s Overview or Audio settings.

!!MuseSystemAudioDeviceButton

Once properly shared, you will see Muse Audio Share in the Sidebar input list.

### 2. Set Muse Audio Share as your DAW's audio output

NOTE: when using Muse Audio Share, Local Loopback should be ENABLED so that you can also hear the audio. You can do this in Muse's Audio Settings or by clicking the LB button next to your device so it highlights yellow.
