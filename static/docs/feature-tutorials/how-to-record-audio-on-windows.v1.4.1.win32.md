You can record any audio device in the session by clicking the "R" button next to it.
When the R button is highlighted yellow, the device is being recorded. Press "R" again to stop the recording.

By default, Muse saves recorded audio to a file on your computer.
You can access recent recordings or change the save location of the files by clicking the arrow to the right of the "R" button.

You can also change the recording settings in [Recording Settings](museapp://session-settings/recording)

NOTE: Now you can record audio from Muse directly into your DAW. Update to the latest version of Muse to access this feature
