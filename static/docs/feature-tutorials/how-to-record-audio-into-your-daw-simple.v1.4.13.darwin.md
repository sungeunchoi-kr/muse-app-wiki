By default, Muse saves recorded audio to a file on your computer. You can enable simple recording in [Recording Settings](museapp://session-settings/recording)
<br>
<br>

When simple recording is enabled, recorded audio will pass through the Muse Recording device when you begin the recording process. You can select Muse Recording as an input in your DAW to record the audio from Muse. There is no additional setup but there will be a delay in the recording.
