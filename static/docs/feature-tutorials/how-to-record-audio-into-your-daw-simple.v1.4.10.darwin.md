By default, Muse saves recorded audio to a file on your computer. You can enable simple recording in [Recording Settings](museapp://session-settings/recording)
<br>
<br>

When simple recording is enabled, recorded audio will pass through the Muse Recording device when you begin the recording process. There is no additional setup but there will be a delay in the recording. 
<br>
<br>

## 1\. Enable Simple Recording
