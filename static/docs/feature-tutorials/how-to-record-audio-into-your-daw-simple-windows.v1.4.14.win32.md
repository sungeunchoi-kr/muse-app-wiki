If you use Pro Tools, Studio One, or Cubase, follow the [Recording Plugin Tutorial](https://www.musesessions.co/recording-manual) to record without changing your I/O.

When simple recording is enabled, recorded audio from Muse will pass through the selected recording device which you can select as an input in your DAW.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Windows users will need to use a separate device for recording and for sharing DAW audio. We recommend downloading [VoiceMeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/) or [Hi-Fi Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm#DownloadASIOBridge) for recording, so that you can use [VB-Audio Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) to share DAW audio. Be sure to follow instructions on these Virtual Audio devices before use.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Simple Recording MUST be enabled in Muse's recording settings or the Recording Plugin won't work. By default, Muse saves recorded audio to a file. You can turn this off in settings.
