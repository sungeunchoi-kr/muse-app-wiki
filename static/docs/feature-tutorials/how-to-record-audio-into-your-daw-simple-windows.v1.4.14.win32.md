By default, Muse saves recorded audio to a file on your computer. You can enable simple recording in [Recording Settings](museapp://session-settings/recording)
<br>
<br>

When simple recording is enabled, audio recorded in Muse will pass through the selected recording device when you begin the recording process. There is no additional setup but there will be a delay in the recording.
