To send MIDI to everyone in the session, select the MIDI Device you want to share as an input in Muse's MIDI Settings.

NOTE: Some MIDI devices have multiple inputs. If the first input doesnâ€™t work, try the other inputs.

To receive MIDI into your DAW, make sure Muse MIDI Output is enabled in the DAW. You can do this in your DAW's MIDI settings.
