There can be a few reasons why you hear an echo when using Muse.

{{"class": "collapse", "title": "1. Hearing an echo from Muse Audio Share"}}
In some cases you might hear an echo coming from Muse Audio Share. 
This can happen when using a multi-output device or if you have a custom audio routing setup.

To remove the echo, turn Local Loopback OFF for Muse Audio Share.
You can do this in Muse's Audio Settings or by clicking the LB button next to your device so it turns grey.

You or another user in the session might be sharing HQ audio from the microphone. When you share HQ audio, echo cancellation is disabled from the device.

To remove the echo, turn HQ audio OFF for the microphone. You can do this in Muse's Audio Settings or by clicking the HQ button next to your device so it turns grey.

Alternatively, you can use talkback (push-to-talk) to mute your microphone until you press the trigger key.
