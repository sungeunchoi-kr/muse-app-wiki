Check that the Muse Plugin is on the master track or a track receiving audio in your DAW and that the status is GOOD

Make sure VB Cable is showing in the sidebar. If it's not visible in the sidebar, Select CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable) below or from Museâ€™s Overview or Audio settings.

If the plugin status is GOOD and VB Cable is shared in the sidebar, check that the volume of VB Cable is turned up all the way and that it isn't muted in your computer's audio settings.
