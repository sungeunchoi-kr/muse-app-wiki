There can be a few reasons why you don't hear audio from VB Cable.

Make sure Local Loopback is ENABLED for VB Cable.
You can do this in Muse's Audio Settings or by clicking the LB button next to your device so it highlights yellow.

Check that the volume of VB Cable is turned up all the way and that it isn't muted in your computer's audio settings.

If the volume is up and you still can’t hear anything from VB Cable, make sure VB Cable is selected as the output for the device or app you’re trying to share audio from.
