Check that the Muse Plugin is on the master track or a track receiving audio in your DAW and that the status is GOOD

Make sure Muse DAW Bridge (DAW Audio) is showing in the sidebar. If it's not visible in the sidebar, you can enable it in Muse's Audio Settings by clicking "always share the Muse DAW Bridge device"

If the plugin status is GOOD and Muse DAW Bridge is shared in the sidebar, open Audio MIDI Setup and check that the volume of Muse DAW Bridge is turned up all the way and that it isn't muted. 

You can open Audio MIDI Setup by clicking the link below or by navigating to the app in Finder > Applications > Utilities
