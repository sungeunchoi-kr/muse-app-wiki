If the audio quality of your devices sound distorted, check that the internet speed isn't too slow. With a stable internet connection, there should be no disruptions in audio streaming.

If your internet connection is stable but your computer is running slower than normal, try decreasing the quality of your video or stop sharing your video entirely to see if that fixes the problem. You can do this in Muse's Video Settings under "Select Video Quality"

If the speed of your computer and internet are normal, try to change the quality of your device to HQ. You can do this in Muse's Audio Settings or by clicking the HQ button next to your device so it highlights yellow.
