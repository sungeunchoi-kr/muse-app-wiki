If you are using a multi-channel device such as an audio interface or mixer, and others can only hear it from one side of their headphones/speaker, it's likely the device is in mono.
By default, Muse shares channels 1 & 2 in stereo from multi-channel devices.

To fix the problem, go to Muse's Audio Settings and switch the device to MONO.
